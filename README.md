## Overview

In this project I redesigned an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

## App features

- App uses the Design Support library and its provided widget types (FloatingActionButton, AppBarLayout, SnackBar, etc).
- App uses CoordinatorLayout for the main Activity.
- App theme extends from AppCompat.
- App uses an AppBar and associated Toolbars.
- App provides a Floating Action Button for the most common action(s).
- App properly specifies elevations for app bars, FABs, and other elements specified in the Material Design specification.
- App has a consistent color theme defined in styles.xml. Color theme does not impact usability of the app.
- App provides sufficient space between text and surrounding elements.
- App uses images that are high quality, specific, and full bleed.
- App uses fonts that are either the Android defaults, are complementary, and aren't otherwise distracting.
- App uses Picasso, Picasso Pallette to display the Images and choose the color of the text view and textview bar according to the pallette of the image loaded.
